# Project Description

## Dataset
This project uses a dataset containing sleep and health-related information for over 100 individuals.  
The dataset includes variables such as **Quality of Sleep**, **Stress Level**, **Sleep Duration**, and **Physical Activity Level**.  
The data is stored in JSON format and allows comparison between sleep quality and different health metrics.

## Visualization
The data is visualized using **Chart.js**.  
A bar chart displays the **average value of a selected health metric for each sleep quality level**, making it easy to observe trends and differences across sleep quality categories.

## Interactivity
An interactive **dropdown menu** allows users to switch between different metrics:
- Average Stress Level  
- Average Sleep Duration  
- Average Physical Activity Level  

When the selected metric changes, the chart updates dynamically without reloading the page.

## Styling
Custom CSS is applied to improve readability and visual clarity.  
The layout centers the chart on the page, uses a clean background, and applies spacing, typography, and subtle shadows to create a polished presentation.

## Summary
This project demonstrates how data can be grouped, aggregated, and visualized interactively using JavaScript and Chart.js, helping users better understand the relationship between sleep quality and health outcomes.
